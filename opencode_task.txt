1. Difference between Git and Git-hub---
                     . Git is a version control system that keeps track of the changes we are committing to a file or any repository. While git-hub is a location where we can store all these things.
                     . Git-hub is a web-based git repository. We Can see that Git as a single computer and GitHub as a network of multiple interconnected computers.
Both together provides a system for contributing to open source. Using git commands we can make changes in the files while GitHub hosts all of these.  
2.  Some commands and their functions—
                         a) git status  used to know the state of the working directory and staging area.
                        b) git init  used to create a local repository.
                        C) git add --a  used to stage all the files of the working directory.
                        d) git clone  used to make a copy of a repository from an existing URL.
                        e) git commit -m  used to commit changes in the files of the current working directory with a comment.      
3. How to do a pull request?
              --> While working on any other's project, we need to make a copy of that project by doing fork on github. 
              --> After cloning that project to our local git,we can make some changes on that.
              -->After doing all the changes and committing it,we push that to our github fork. (git push url_name)
                         Then there in our repository will show it as a new commit,we can send a pull request to the original repo.
                        There is a pull request option on our github,we have to click that and have to add a proper comment with that.
